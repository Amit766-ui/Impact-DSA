Static Block & Constructor

Constructors are used to initialise the objects for every class there will be a default constructor, whenever we create an object constructor will be called then object will be created.

Constructor having class name are method properties.

Eg-  
public class q2{
   public static void main(String args[]){
       Demo d1=new Demo();
       Demo d2=new Demo();
   }
}
class Demo{
   static{
      System.out.println("Static Block");
   }
   Demo(){
      System.out.println("Constructor");
   }
}

Static-
Static block will be created with a static keyword it will be called automatically no need to call it, either object or class.

Static method- for a static method no need to call with a object, you can directly call with a class name and here static will act as instance or object.

conditional statements-
if-else, else if ladder, switch case
conditional statements are used to check the condition and to print the relevant block in constant time.

if(a<b){
   System.ot.println("A is smaller");
}else{
  System.out.println("B is smaller");
}

conditional statements are used to get the output in constant time.
when we know the range we prefer to use for loop. and when we don't know the range we prefer to use while loop.
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
  System.ot.println("Increasing");
}

while(b<a){
   System.ot.println("Increasing");
}
